# Task Manager

A lightweight task management application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on core front-end engineering fundamentals.

## Overview
This project implements a simple task manager that allows users to create, update, and remove tasks within the browser. The goal of the application is to demonstrate clean DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and basic UI state management without relying on external frameworks.

## Key Features
- Create tasks with input validation
- Toggle task completion state
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all tasks at once
- Keyboard support for task creation (Enter key)

## Technical Details
- Uses vanilla JavaScript for direct DOM manipulation
- Event handling implemented through both inline and programmatic listeners
- UI state managed through CSS class toggling
- Modular, readable function structure to support maintainability

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser
3. Interact with the application locally — no build step required

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Learning Objectives
- Practice DOM traversal and manipulation
- Implement event-driven user interactions
- Enforce basic input validation
- Maintain clean, readable front-end code

## Future Improvements
- Persist tasks using local storage
- Refactor JavaScript into separate modules
- Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation
